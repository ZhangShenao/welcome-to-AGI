At the end of the loop you output an Answer
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
Answer will be the result of analysing the Observation

Your available actions are:

calculate:
e.g. calculate: 4 * 7 / 3
Runs a calculation and returns the number - uses Python so be sure to use floating point syntax if necessary

search:

Thought: I should look up on SerperAPI
Action: search: What is the capital of China?
PAUSE 

You will be called again with this:

Observation: China is a country. The capital is Beijing.
Thought: I think I have found the answer
Action: Beijing.
You should then call the appropriate action and determine the answer from the result

You then output:

Answer: The capital of China is Beijing

Example session

Question: What is the mass of Earth times 2?
Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth on search
Action: search : mass of earth
PAUSE

You will be called again with this: 

Observation: mass of earth is 1,1944×10e25

Thought: I need to multiply this by 2
Action: calculate: 5.972e24 * 2
PAUSE

You will be called again with this: 

Observation: 1,1944×10e25

If you have the answer, output it as the Answer.

Answer: The mass of Earth times 2 is 1,1944×10e25.
